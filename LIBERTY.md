## United States of America

In the colonies, freedom was now thought of as a universal entitlement. In the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, there was a fear of centralized government. After awhile though, many began to see the government not as an antagonist to freedom, but as an accomplice and promoter of it. Freedom of expression and of religion were now considered by many in the colonies to be universal entitlements. While those who were white enjoyed unprecedented levels of freedom, freedom in the United States was hardly universal.
Women’s freedom was severely limited by the patriarchal structure of American society. The growing “cult of domesticity” promoted and even romanticized women being limited to the domestic sphere, although at the same time many women also started to work factory jobs. The seeds of feminism had also been laid at this point by those such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Judith Sargent Murray. Those seeds were watered by the growing concern for the rights of women in the early 1800s, led primarily by activists such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton. They were still unable to vote, although the subject of women’s suffrage had been discussed. The Married Women’s Property Acts had also begun to be passed during this time, which began to grant women more control over property and allow them to work for a salary.
The freedom of blacks was limited by the existence of slavery, which had now grown to be a dependency of the southern states, even more than indentured servitude. The slave rebellions that followed after the Haitian Revolution, such as Gabriel’s Rebellion, Nat Turner’s Rebellion, and the Denmark Veasy conspiracy, would both weaken the institution, but also strengthen the severity of slave laws. Slavery was no longer considered by many in the South to just be a necessary evil, but was instead seen as beneficial to its subjects. Just like women, blacks could not vote in most states. Americans would also continue to treat the Native Americans as if they were subhuman, and the Louisiana Purchase granted an entire new swathe of land to steal from them. Furthermore, Indians in the east were forced to relocate to unfamiliar lands thanks to the Indian Removal Act.

### The North

Slavery in the North was not as common as in the South, as northerners often owned smaller farms. However, the industrial North still relied heavily on the slavery of the South, as the many textile mills rquired cotton.

### The South

The prominence of slavery within the South brought with it an oppressive and rigid class system. Essentially, freedom for those who did not own slaves was restricted, while those who held many had great power. The upper echelon of this class structure was the planter class, who owned 20 or more slaves. The invention of the cotton gin also made sure that the institution would continue, and made cotton the dominant crop of the South.
