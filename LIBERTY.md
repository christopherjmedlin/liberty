## The English

Freedom expanded thanks to the rise of Lockean liberalism and the English Civil War, which had now spread to the colonies. It was still thought that true freedom could only be enjoyed by the rich and powerful, but the idea was challenged by the opposing idea that all Englishmen were entitled to certain rights. Freedom of expression and of religion were more commonplace than before, thanks to the Great Awakening and the John Peter Zenger trial. One had to own property in order to vote, as it was thought that people still living in their mother’s house would not make good voters. 
Women’s freedom was severely limited by the patriarchal structure of English (and European) society, as coverture made sure that women surrendered all of their legal identity to their husband. They were also unable to vote or own property. 
The freedom of blacks was limited by the existence of the slave trade, which had now grown to be a dependency of the colonies, even more than indentured servitude. Just like women, blacks could not vote in colonial society. The colonies would also continue to treat the Native Americans as if they were subhuman.

### New England

They succeeded in recreating the patriarchal family structure of England, hurting womens’ freedom in the colonies.

### Chesapeake

The expansion of slavery within the Chesapeake colonies brought with it an oppresive and rigid class system. Essentially, freedom for those who did not own slaves was restricted, while those who held many had great power.

## Native Americans

Most Native American societies lacked concepts of class and race. For this reason, freedom was something that many people could enjoy, it often being the default way of life for many Indians. As a concept, it didn’t really exist for them.
