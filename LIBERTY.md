Trial of Anne Hutchinson

## The English

To the English, freedom was something that could be attained through living a life free of sin and devotion to God. True freedom was something only enjoyed by the rich and powerful. Freedom of expression and of religion were both uncommon, with the exceptions of Rhode Island and Maryland. One also had to own property in order to vote. 
Women’s freedom was  limited by the patriarchal structure of English (and European) society, as coverture made sure that women surrendered all of their legal identity to their husband. Witch trials, while not as common as before, still occurred. They were also unable to vote or own property (with certain exceptions). 
The freedom of blacks was limited by the existence of the slave trade, although indentured servitude was still more prevalent than slavery. Just like women, blacks could not vote in colonial society.

### New England

In New England, the Puritan theocratic government allowed very little freedom of religion, persecuting anybody shown to have un-Puritan beliefs. They also succeeded in recreating the patriarchal family structure of England, hurting womens’ freedom in the colonies.

### Chesapeake

While men were still considered superior in Chesapeake, women gained limited property rights due to the low life expectancy of the colonies, as they often had to take their husbands’ farms.

## Native Americans

Most Native American societies lacked concepts of class and race. For this reason, freedom was something that many people could enjoy, it often being the default way of life for many Indians. As a concept, it didn’t really exist for them.
