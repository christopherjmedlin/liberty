The Louisiana Purchase

## United States of America

In the colonies, freedom was now thought of as a universal entitlement. In the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, there was a fear of centralized government. After awhile though, many began to see the government not as an antagonist to freedom, but as an accomplice and promoter of it. Freedom of expression and of religion were now also considered by many in the colonies to be universal entitlements. One had to own property in order to vote, as it was thought that people still living in their mother’s house would not make good voters. In practice, freedom in the United States was hardly universal. 
Women’s freedom was severely limited by the patriarchal structure of American society, as coverture made sure that women surrendered all of their legal identity to their husband. However, the concept of republican motherhood promoted women’s education and made their work more important. The seeds of feminism had also been laid at this point by those such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Judith Sargent Murray. They were still unable to vote or own property. 
The freedom of blacks was limited by the existence of slavery, which had now grown to be a dependency of the southern states, even more than indentured servitude. The slave rebellions that followed after the Haitian Revolution, such as Gabriel’s Rebellion, would both weaken the institution, but also strengthen the severity of slave laws. Many understood it to be evil, but considered it to be a necessary one. Just like women, blacks could not vote in most states. Americans would also continue to treat the Native Americans as if they were subhuman, and the Louisiana Purchase granted an entire new swathe of land to steal from them.

### The North

Slavery in the North was not as common as in the South, as northerners often owned smaller farms.

### The South

The prominence of slavery within the South brought with it an oppressive and rigid class system. Essentially, freedom for those who did not own slaves was restricted, while those who held many had great power. The invention of the cotton gin also made sure that the institution would continue, and made cotton the dominant crop of the South.
