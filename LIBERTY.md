Gettysburg Address

## United States of America

In the colonies, freedom was now thought of as a universal entitlement, and there was a great effort to come to terms with the fact that slavery grossly contradicted this. In the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, there was a fear of centralized government. After awhile though, many began to see the government not as an antagonist to freedom, but as an accomplice and promoter of it. Freedom of expression and of religion were now considered by many in the colonies to be universal entitlements. This would change temporarily during wartime, however, as the Civil War called for Lincoln to suspend habeas corpus. While those who were white enjoyed unprecedented levels of freedom, freedom in the United States was hardly universal.
Women’s freedom was severely limited by the patriarchal structure of American society. The growing “cult of domesticity” promoted and even romanticized women being limited to the domestic sphere, although at the same time many women also started to work factory jobs. The seeds of feminism had also been laid at this point by those such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Judith Sargent Murray. Those seeds were watered by the growing concern for the rights of women in the early 1800s, led primarily by activists such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton. They were still unable to vote, although the subject of women’s suffrage had been discussed. The Married Women’s Property Acts had also begun to be passed during this time, which began to grant women more control over property and allow them to work for a salary. The Civil War saw many women playing a part greater than in previous war efforts.
In 1865, slavery was finally abolished. The fight for true equality, however, still continues to this day. Just like women, blacks could not vote in most states. Americans would also continue to treat the Native Americans as if they were subhuman, and the Louisiana Purchase granted an entire new swathe of land to steal from them. Furthermore, Indians in the east were forced to relocate to unfamiliar lands thanks to the Indian Removal Act.
