# What?

Normally, this is a website used to host source code for programs, but I used it instead to show how liberty changed overtime. Git (the system that powers Github) allows you to make changes to a file, and you are able to go back and see what the file was like before these changes. Each change is called a "commit", and I made one for each era which edits a file called "LIBERTY.md" which contains the definition of freedom/liberty. Each commit also has a message that goes more in depth into what events and conditions caused the definition of freedom to change.

The section above contains the aforementioned commit message, which describes the events that took place.
In the bottom section, whatever is highlighted in red was deleted or modified, and whatever is highlighted in green was added.
The two buttons that I highlighted with a red rectangle allow you to switch between the text version of the file and the formatted file, which shows the image.
